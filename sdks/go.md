# Go SDK

High-performance, zero-dependency SDK designed for backend services and microservice architectures.

### Smart Routing
The Go SDK features a unified `Client` that automatically routes requests based on the authentication options provided during initialization (`WithBearerAuth`).

* **Authenticated Mode**: Targets `/v2` endpoints for Agent-led execution.
* **Public Mode**: Targets `/api` endpoints for public intent creation.
